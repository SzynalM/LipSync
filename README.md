# LipSync
Unity Editor extension that allows the generation of lip sync data directly from the AudioClip inspector window. 
It uses the open source library CMUSphinx for speech analysis and bases animation on BlendShapes. 
It also has an example implementation of an animator, that moves a character's lips in sync with spoken dialogue.
